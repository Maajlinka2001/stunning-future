# stunning-future
advanced programming project

### Requirements for programmers

1. Import appropriate libraries
2. Upload datasets
3. Data Exploration
     - dataset organisation - shape (dimensions with rows and columns)
     - pick up the data to check the structure (print(data.head()))
     - statistical summary (print(data.describe()))
     - missing data (print(data.isnull().sum()))
     - type of the data (print(data.dtypes))
     - class distribution in the target var (print(data['target_column'].value_counts())) # We don't have the classes yet, we need to create the classes ourselves
     - number of the participants
4. Data Visualisation
5. Data Preprocessing - every variable that will be included in the model
6. CREATING the model
   - Splitting the Dataset
   - Checking the relationships between the variabels to obtain the most accurate and precise
   - Visualisation of the outcomes
