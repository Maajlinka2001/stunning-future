# stunning-future
advanced programming project
#### Theory presentation 


### Requirements for programmers

1. Import appropriate libraries
2. Upload datasets
3. Data Exploration
     - dataset organisation - shape (dimensions with rows and columns)
     - pick up the data to check the structure (print(data.head()))
     - statistical summary (print(data.describe()))
     - missing data (print(data.isnull().sum()))
     - type of the data (print(data.dtypes))
     - class distribution in the target var (print(data['target_column'].value_counts())) # We don't have the classes yet, we need to create the classes ourselves
     - number of the participants
4. Data Visualisation
remik
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Splitting the Dataset?
7. Fit the model
5. Data Preprocessing - every variable that will be included in the model
6. CREATING the model
   - Splitting the Dataset
   - Checking the relationships between the variabels to obtain the most accurate and precise
   - Visualisation of the outcomes

### Requirements

- research questions
- predicted outcomes
- what we want to see from the programmers

### Features

functionalities:
- uploading data,
- data exploration,
- creating model,
- training model,
- evaluating the model,
- data visualisation

### Milestones and Work distribution

- clustering of future_time_perspective
- data exploration of all the data: correlation table,
- feature extraction from ex CERQ
- creating model
- training
- evaluation

### Expected challanges

pokazywaÄ‡ bÅ‚Ä™dy + jakie sÄ… nasze decyzje 

- clustering of our dependnet variable (future prediction)
- extracting only one subscale from the questionarries
- making classes workðŸ™‚
- training the model
- choosing the best learning rate
- everything can be challenging

### Classes design - our own:)

- ladowanie kwestionariusza +  preprocessing konkrtenego kwestionariusza
- feature extraction from ex CERQ

### Libraries

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numPy
- Scikit-learn
- seaborn
- Plotly - interactive plot
